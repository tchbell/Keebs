                    Olyvia is described by her mother as a fun-loving and caring young lady. Olyvia enjoys many outdoor
                    activities like horseback riding, swimming, bicycling, camping and listening to music. When she's
                    not
                    exploring the world, she's with her friends, spending time with family, playing board games or
                    listening
                    to audio books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In April 2022, Olyvia was diagnosed with lymphoma. "Even though times got tough and there were times
                    she
                    didn't feel well," said Wish mom Ronda. "She still did volunteer work on a farm, at a school and
                    continued to stay positive."
                </p>

                <p>
                    For her wish, Olyvia wants to visit her aunt who lives in Beeville, Texas, near San Antonio. Her
                    aunt
                    owns a duplex, and Olyvia and family are excited to stay in the other half of it, which is currently
                    unoccupied. Olyvia also requested that her wish take place during Christmas break so she didn't miss
                    any
                    school.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Olyvia and family have at least two treks planned for their Texas adventure. First, they reckon
                    they'll
                    saddle up some horses and canter over to an outdoor cookout spot for a big hootenanny. Then, they'll
                    mosey to Six Flags Fiesta and ride the rip-roaring roller coasters.
                </p>
